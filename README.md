# Kernel Module to translate given virtual address with process id to physical address

# Instructions
## Downloading and extracting Kernel
### Downloading Kernel
 [linux-kernel-4.9.40](https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/linux-4.9.40.tar.xz)
or use `wget https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/linux-4.9.40.tar.xz` and after extract it.
### Extracting
`tar -xvf linux-4.9.40.tar.xz`

## Running scripts
### Copy this(virtualtophysical) folder to same directory which linux-4.9.40 is in.

### Run copy_files.sh to copy necessary kernel config files
`./copy_files.sh`
### Run compile_kernel.sh with root privilege to start compiling kernel
`sudo ./compile_kernel.sh`
In order to compile linux kernel config file must created. We are creating config file with default values.
Follow the following steps.

![menuconfig2](https://github.com/omerfdemir/virtualtophysical/blob/master/images/2.png)
![menuconfig3](https://github.com/omerfdemir/virtualtophysical/blob/master/images/3.png)
![menuconfig4](https://github.com/omerfdemir/virtualtophysical/blob/master/images/4.png)
After doing that compiling script will continue.
It can take 30+ minutes based on computer specifications.

After compiling kernel reboot the machine with `reboot` command.

Check your new kernel version with `uname -r` command.
##Testing
Run allocate_memory script by typing `./allocate_memory.sh` command. It allocates memory and return virtual address and physical address.

![allocate_memory_script](https://github.com/omerfdemir/virtualtophysical/blob/master/images/allocate_memory_script.png)

To check physical address of other process we need to know process id and virtual address of that process.

Check the id of testscript with typing `ps -aux | grep allocate_memory.o`
![pid](https://github.com/omerfdemir/virtualtophysical/blob/master/images/pid.png)

Run trysyscall script by typing `./trysyscall.sh pid virtual_address` Where pid is result of  `ps -aux | grep allocate_memory.o` and virtual_address is printed value after running `./allocate_memory.sh` script.

By doing that we can reach physical value of a process within another process with process id and virtual address of that process.
